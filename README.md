# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Truffle compile, migrate and run

1. Start by cloning this repository </br>
2. Inside the new folder, "npm install" to install all req'd dependencies </br>
3. Open up Ganache and click 'Quick Start' </br>
4. Go to your terminal, cd your folder and '<strong>truffle compile</strong>' to compile your contracts </br>
5. Then migrate your contracts to deploy to our local blockchain aka ganache - '<strong>truffle migrate</strong>' </br>
6. Go to your metamask extension and create a new network configured to your Ganache network. In that network, import a new account w/ one of the private keys inside your Ganache. </br>
7. In your metamask extension add a new token with contract address of "Asset" as this will be the NFT token for the property added or purchased. </br
8. '<strong>npm start</strong>' to load up the project on your local browser. (make sure you're on your ganache network in your metamask extension) </br>
